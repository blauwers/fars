# FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System)

This package is intended to meet the requirements of the week 4 assignment in the Coursera course - Building R Packages.

The functions in this package work with data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. You can download the data this package was developed for here:
